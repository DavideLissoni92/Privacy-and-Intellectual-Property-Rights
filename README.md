# Introduction

Thanks to the rapid development of technology and the huge amount of
software that nowadays exist, different needs and trains of thoughts, related to
this issue, start to gain a place in the world and especially in the market.
Usually, people ideas can be divided in two different main schools of thoughts
such as liberal and conservative thinking. These two strands are applicable in
the software industry as well, especially talking about proprietary and free and
open-source software. This paper will focus on Free/Libre Open Source
Software (FLOSS) ideology in the today's market, making first of all a
summary of free software history and concepts and then deepening on the
impact, the benefit and the view of the free software movement in the software
industry comparing them also with some private software characteristics.
